# Goal_Reach

This is a simple program to define goals with durations for a Month, then generate a printable checklist.

To use - 

1. Download the archive and unzip
2. Use pipenv sync to mirror the dependencies
3. Run "Goal Manager v1.py" to start the program.
4. Once you complete the wizard, it will open the checklist as a html file.

Hope this helps someone think about their goals in an organized way.

Thank you for downloading!
